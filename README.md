## Introduction
Branch prediction is a crucial aspect of modern high-performance computing systems. Poor branch prediction can lead to significant performance bottlenecks. The project aims to investigate advanced algorithms for branch prediction, particularly Perceptron-based predictors, to improve prediction accuracy and efficiency. Various flavors of Perceptron predictors, such as Strided Sampling Hashed Perceptron Predictor and Multiperspective Perceptron Predictor with TAGE, will also be explored.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your_username/ECE587-AdvancedBranchPrediction.git

2. Navigate to the directory:
cd ECE587-AdvancedBranchPrediction

3. Follow additional setup instructions as needed.

## Usage
1. Run the SimpleScalar simulator with the implemented branch predictor algorithm:
./simulator_command_here

2. Analyze the results and compare with existing benchmarks.
